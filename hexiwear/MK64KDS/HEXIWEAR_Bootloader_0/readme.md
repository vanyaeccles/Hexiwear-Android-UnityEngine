# HEXIWEAR Bootloader Project Guide

In order to build the project successfully, it is necessary for the Kinetis SDK build variable to be configured properly.
By default, this variable points to the location: "c:\Freescale\KSDK_1.2.0" (without the quotes).

If a Kinetis SDK is located elsewhere, user must reconfigure this variable.
Variable can be found in Project Properties -> Build Variables tab, where it can be modified.
